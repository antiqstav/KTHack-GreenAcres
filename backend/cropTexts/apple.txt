Apple
Apples are popular, nutritious fruits that thrive in temperate climates with plenty of sunlight and well-drained soil.

How to plant it:

Plant apple seeds or saplings in holes twice as wide and deep as the root systems.
Space trees 15-20 feet apart for standard varieties and 10-15 feet apart for dwarf varieties.
Best practices:

Maintain soil pH between 6.0-6.8.
Mulch around the base to retain moisture and prevent weeds.
Prune regularly to encourage fruiting and remove diseased branches.
