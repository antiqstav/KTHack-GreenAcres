Muskmelon
Muskmelon, a sweet and aromatic fruit, thrives in warm climates with sandy loam soil and good drainage.

How to plant it:

Sow seeds 1 inch deep and space them 12-18 inches apart.
Maintain a row spacing of 4-6 feet to allow vines to spread.
Best practices:

Use compost or well-rotted manure at planting.
Provide consistent watering, especially during flowering and fruiting stages.
Support fruiting vines with mulch to prevent rot.
