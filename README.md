## Our solution solution

Because of the ubiquity and usefulness of AI in everyday applications, we decided to develop a one-stop solution for the beginning farmer.
The app boasts an intuitive UI for farmers who aren't tech-savvy. The features of the application include:
* Crop management
  * Farmers can add and maintain crops on the management console, where they can see the net profit (or loss) if they were to harvest their crops now.
* Best Crop Calculator, provided by the power of AI
  * Farmers can now input their location into the AI response page, and they can get the best crop in their area, based on the soil quality and the climate in the area. Using a TensorFlow model that we trained, the farmer can now minimize their crop waste and maximize their impact on the environment.
